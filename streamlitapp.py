### About This Model 🏀📊  
This model predicts the top 5 MVP candidates for each season from **1982 to 2024** using **Ridge Regression**.  
Ridge Regression is a machine learning technique that improves predictions by **penalizing large coefficients**, making the model more stable and reducing overfitting.

The model's performance is measured using **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**, which is **0.7599**.  
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: Measures how well the model ranks the correct players at the top.  
  - A score of **1.0** means perfect ranking.  
  - Our score of **0.7599** indicates strong but not perfect predictions.

### 📂 Where to Find the Code  
The full **data scraping, data cleaning, and model training** process can be found in this GitHub repository:  
👉 [NBA-MVP-2025 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SalyanKarki/NBA-MVP-2025)  

### 📊 Data Source  
The data used for training the model was taken from **[Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)**,  
which provides historical MVP voting data and player statistics.

### Column Definitions 📊  
- **Player**: The name of the MVP candidate.  
- **Share**: The percentage of MVP votes received (1.0 = 100% of votes).  
- **Rk (Rank)**: The actual ranking based on votes.  
- **Predicted_Rk**: The rank predicted by the Ridge Regression model.  
- **Diff**: Difference between the predicted and actual ranking (**negative = underestimated**, **positive = overestimated**).
